.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Integrates standard traceroute as a probe into smokeping.  The use
case for this probe is gateways that do not respond to \s-1TCP/UDP/ICMP\s0
packets addressed to them, but do return \s-1ICMP TTL_EXCEEDED\s0 packets for
traceroute packets to a host they route to.  It is best used in
situations where routing for the path is static or nearly so;
attempting to use this on networks with changing routing will yield
poor results.  The best place to use this probe is on first\- and
last-mile links, which are more likely to have static routing and
also more likely to have firewalls that ignore \s-1ICMP ECHO_REQUEST.\s0
.PP
The mandatory probe variable \fBbinary\fR must have an executable path for
traceroute.
.PP
The optional probe variable \fBbinaryv6\fR sets an executable path for
your IPv6 traceroute.  If this is set to the same value as \fBbinary\fR,
TraceroutePing will use the \-6 flag when running traceroute for IPv6
addresses.  If this variable is not set, TraceroutePing will try to
find an functioning IPv6 traceroute.  It will first try appending \*(L"6\*(R"
to the path in \fBbinary\fR, then try including the \*(L"\-6\*(R" flag in a test
command.  Note that Linux appears to have a wide variety of IPv6
traceroute implementations.  My Ubuntu 14.04 machine has
/usr/sbin/traceroute6 from iputils, but /usr/bin/traceroute (from
Dmitry Butskoy) accepts the \-6 flag and is actually a better
implementation.  You may need to let TraceroutePing autodetect this, or
experiment to find the best traceroute.
.PP
The mandatory target variable \fBdesthost\fR must name a destination host
for the probe.  The destination host itself is not of interest and no
data is gathered on it, its only purpose is to route traffic past your
actual target.  Selection of a destination just past your target, with
static or strongly preferred routing through your target, will get
better data.
.PP
The mandatory target variable \fBhost\fR must name the target host for
the probe.  This is the router that you want to collect \s-1RTT\s0 data for.
This variable must either be the valid reverse-lookup name of the
router, or its \s-1IP\s0 address.  Using the \s-1IP\s0 address is preferable since
it allows us to tell traceroute to avoid \s-1DNS\s0 lookups.
.PP
The target variables \fBminttl\fR and \fBmaxttl\fR can be used to describe
the range of expected hop counts to \fBhost\fR.  On longer paths or paths
through unresponsive gateways or ending in unresponsive hosts, this
reduces the amount of time this probe takes to execute.  These default
to 1 and 30.
.PP
The target variables \fBwait\fR sets the traceroute probe timeout in
seconds.  This defaults to 1, instead of the traditionally higher
value used by \s-1LBL\s0 traceroute.  Traceroute programs often enforce a
lower bound on this value.
.SH "VARIABLES"
.IX Header "VARIABLES"
Supported probe-specific variables:
.IP "binary" 4
.IX Item "binary"
The location of your traceroute binary.
.Sp
Example value: /usr/bin/traceroute
.Sp
This setting is mandatory.
.IP "binaryv6" 4
.IX Item "binaryv6"
The location of your IPv6 traceroute binary.
.Sp
Example value: /usr/bin/traceroute6
.IP "forks" 4
.IX Item "forks"
Run this many concurrent processes at maximum
.Sp
Example value: 5
.Sp
Default value: 5
.IP "offset" 4
.IX Item "offset"
If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from
hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-specific
offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe will
be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as
\&'random', and the offset from the 'General' section is used if nothing
is specified here. Note that this does \s-1NOT\s0 influence the rrds itself,
it is just a matter of when data acqusition is initiated.
(This variable is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set
in the 'General' section.)
.Sp
Example value: 50%
.IP "step" 4
.IX Item "step"
Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if different
from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that the step in
the \s-1RRD\s0 files is fixed when they are originally generated, and if you
change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old \s-1RRD\s0
files or somehow convert them. (This variable is only applicable if
the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)
.Sp
Example value: 300
.IP "timeout" 4
.IX Item "timeout"
How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum
.Sp
Example value: 15
.Sp
Default value: 5
.PP
Supported target-specific variables:
.IP "desthost" 4
.IX Item "desthost"
Final destination host for traceroute packets.  Does not have to be reachable unless it is also your host.
.Sp
Example value: www.example.com
.Sp
This setting is mandatory.
.IP "host" 4
.IX Item "host"
Host of interest to monitor.  Must be either the host's reverse-lookup name, or an \s-1IP\s0 address.
.Sp
Example value: www\-net\-router.example.com
.Sp
This setting is mandatory.
.IP "maxttl" 4
.IX Item "maxttl"
Maximum \s-1TTL.\s0  Set to the maximum expected number of hops to host.
.Sp
Example value: 15
.IP "minttl" 4
.IX Item "minttl"
Minimum \s-1TTL.\s0  Set to the minimum expected number of hops to host.
.Sp
Example value: 11
.IP "pings" 4
.IX Item "pings"
How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the global
value specified in the Database section. Note that the number of pings in
the \s-1RRD\s0 files is fixed when they are originally generated, and if you
change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old \s-1RRD\s0
files or somehow convert them.
.Sp
Example value: 5
.IP "wait" 4
.IX Item "wait"
Waittime.  The timeout value for traceroute's probes, in seconds.
.Sp
Example value: 3
